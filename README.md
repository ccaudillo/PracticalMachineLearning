# PracticalMachineLearning
This repo contains the Practical Machine Learning project.
The task is to train an machine learning algorith with the the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset to predict a categorical variable (Classe) and then apply the model to a new data set to make predictions
The best model was the random forest
